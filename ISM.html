                                “Risks of Digitalisation in Industry 4.0” – In this activity, I analysed Kovaitė and Stankevičienė’s (2019) case study to explore the concept of Industry 4.0, 
                                identifying examples such as IoT and cloud computing. I then examined real-world incidents (e.g., Toyota’s system failure and the SolarWinds hack) to illustrate 
                                risks categorised by the authors. Finally, I reviewed a supporting academic article to strengthen my understanding of how technical and data privacy risks impact digital transformation.

                                In this unit, I learned to identify and categorise information security risks in modern digital environments, especially within Industry 4.0 contexts. 
                                By engaging in the collaborative forum, I critically analysed real-world cases (e.g., Toyota outage, SolarWinds attack) and applied risk-management frameworks such as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and ISO/IEC 27001.

                                I strengthened my analytical and research skills through reviewing academic sources and industry examples. However, I noticed the need to improve my ability to connect technical risks to business impact—especially when evaluating frameworks.<br /><br />

                               This unit focused on understanding the Risk Management Process (RMP), comparing qualitative and quantitative risk assessments, and applying threat modelling in practice. I explored tools and frameworks such as STRIDE, and evaluated publicly available tools to support structured threat analysis in given scenarios.

                                <strong>Summary of Learning Outcomes:</strong><br />
                                This unit deepened my understanding of the threat modelling process by applying STRIDE and DREAD to a fictitional U.S.-based international airport. 
                                I practised decomposing complex threats into structured models, including an attack tree that used AND/OR logic for probabilistic analysis. The exercise highlighted the importance of selecting appropriate threat identification frameworks 
                                and the limitations of static scoring models like CVSS (Spring et al., 2021). Overall, I met the learning outcome of evaluating threat modelling methodologies and justifying the use of frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK and OWASP during system design.

                                Through this exercise, I enhanced my technical documentation and risk analysis skills. I also gained experience in synthesising multiple threat libraries and using formal modelling techniques. However, I found that articulating probabilistic models with clarity was a challenge.<br /><br />

                                - Practise modelling with one additional STRIDE/DREAD scenario outside the coursework.<br />
                                - Explore tools like Microsoft Threat Modelling Tool to visualise complex models more intuitively.<br />
                                - Strengthen my familiarity with ATT&CK mappings to real-world attacker behaviour.

                                This week focused on exploring different approaches to threat modelling and the decision-making process behind selecting a suitable framework. We discussed distinctions between threats and vulnerabilities and reviewed techniques such as STRIDE, DREAD, Attack Trees, and hybrid methods like PASTA. Resources such as OWASP’s Threat Modelling Cookbook were also introduced to support structured modelling decisions.

                              <p>
                                For this exercise, I analysed the relevance of security and privacy standards—GDPR (ICO, 2020), PCI-DSS (PCI SSC, 2020), and HIPAA (HIPAA, 2020)—to a fictional pet-care business. I evaluated the organisation’s processes and determined which regulations applied, how compliance could be verified, and what measures should be implemented.

                              <p>
                                I recommended GDPR compliance for handling customer and pet data, and PCI-DSS for secure payment processing. I assumed the business does not handle protected health information, so HIPAA was not deemed applicable. I also proposed a periodic compliance audit and staff training as part of ongoing controls.

                                In the summative assignment, I conducted a risk assessment for Pampered Pets using STRIDE and DREAD methodologies to evaluate both pre-digital and post-digital states. I identified threats across each phase and suggested mitigation strategies accordingly.

                              <p>
                                The outcome included a recommendation to adopt a phased digital transformation strategy. Using a Gantt chart, I outlined an implementation timeline that balances operational continuity with risk mitigation. This approach enables the business to modernise securely while staying compliant with relevant standards.

                                <strong>Summary of Learning Outcomes:</strong><br />
                                In this unit, I explored the differences between threats and vulnerabilities and reviewed multiple threat modelling frameworks. Applying STRIDE, DREAD, and PASTA helped clarify when to use structured, hybrid, or situational approaches to risk assessment. I successfully applied these insights in the Pampered Pets case study, where I analysed regulatory standards and conducted a digital risk assessment. This directly supports my development in aligning technical risk with business needs.

                                I developed my ability to choose and justify appropriate frameworks and improved my analytical thinking when mapping frameworks to different system phases. One challenge I noted was simplifying technical language for non-technical business contexts.<br /><br />

                                - Create a comparison table of threat modelling techniques with pros/cons and suitable scenarios.<br />
                                - Practise explaining STRIDE and DREAD to a non-technical audience.<br />
                                - Explore a real-world case study using the PASTA model to broaden hybrid modelling experience.<br />
                                - Continue reviewing OWASP resources and apply them to smaller personal projects.

                              <p>
                                This week focused on the strategic role of security standards in risk assessments and the importance of disaster recovery (DR) in ensuring business continuity. Topics included selecting appropriate frameworks for various industries, as well as DR planning concepts like Recovery Time Objective (RTO), Recovery Point Objective (RPO), and deployment types such as hot, warm, and cold standby.
                              </p>

                                <p>
                                  Based on Kirvan (2021), I assessed twelve common security frameworks and matched them to sector-specific needs:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                  <li><strong>International Bank:</strong> ISO/IEC 27001 and NIST CSF – for risk-based ISMS and adaptive incident response.</li>
                                  <li><strong>Large Hospital:</strong> HITRUST CSF and ISO/IEC 27001 – ensuring HIPAA compliance and full governance beyond healthcare-specific systems.</li>
                                  <li><strong>Large Food Manufacturer:</strong> NIST CSF and ISO/IEC 27001 – for IT/OT integration, SCADA system protection, and enterprise-wide security controls.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>
                                  For each case, I recommended key tests such as maturity assessments, gap analyses, and network segmentation reviews. Implementation priorities were drawn around encryption, access controls, compliance audits, and security awareness programmes.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  Through three exercises, I applied DR concepts to technical and strategic design:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                  <li><strong>Activity 1:</strong> Compared hot, warm, and cold standby in terms of RTO/RPO using Abualkishik et al. (2020). Highlighted how virtualisation and clustering improve recovery options.</li>
                                  <li><strong>Activity 2:</strong> Used Morrow et al. (2021) to explore vendor lock-in and security risks in cloud DR. Recommended mitigation via cloud-agnostic tools, encryption, and role-based access.</li>
                                  <li><strong>Activity 3:</strong> Created three DR diagrams for different RTO/RPO scenarios, using clustered and standby systems based on availability needs.</li>
                                </ul>

                              <strong>Summary of Learning Outcomes:</strong><br />
                              This unit strengthened my understanding of how industry standards guide security design and disaster recovery planning. I learned to assess the applicability of frameworks such as ISO/IEC 27001 and NIST CSF to various sectors, and to design DR strategies aligned with RTO/RPO requirements. I also deepened my ability to evaluate trade-offs between high availability, cost, and vendor lock-in risks.

                              I improved my critical evaluation skills when comparing security standards and aligning them with organisational needs. I also gained confidence in designing DR solutions using real-world constraints. However, I want to improve my ability to visualise technical architectures and communicate them to stakeholders.<br /><br />
                        
                              <u>Action Plan:</u><br />
                              - Review visual case studies of DR topologies to enhance architecture design fluency.<br />
                              - Practise summarising key frameworks and DR concepts in business language.<br />
                              - Seek feedback on my DR diagrams from peers/tutors for clarity and completeness.<br />
                              - Explore vendor-neutral DR tools to broaden understanding of cross-platform mitigation options.

        <h2>Unit 5: Future Trends in Security and Risk Management</h2>
      </header>
  
      <p>
        This unit reviewed current and emerging trends in security and risk management, exploring topics such as AI, automation, economic factors, and their implications on future security strategies. 
        The seminar and readings prompted critical evaluation of these trends in relation to future directions in the field.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        By the end of the unit, I was able to assess several emerging technologies—like Automated Cyber Defence (ACD)—and their impact on core risk management principles such as explainability, transparency, and adaptability. I explored how evolving technologies both support and complicate foundational frameworks in risk representation.
      </p>
  
      <hr />
  
      <h3>Wiki Entry: The Evolving Role of Automated Cyber Defence</h3>
      <p>
        My contribution to the collaborative wiki focused on Terje Aven’s (2016) call for transparency in risk assessment. I examined this concept through the lens of Automated Cyber Defence (ACD), highlighting challenges such as explainability, the "reality gap," and evolving AI-based threats. 
        Drawing on Vyas et al. (2023), I proposed strategies including Explainable AI, assumption management and continuous monitoring to support clearer and more trustworthy risk representations in the future.

        <strong>Summary of Learning Outcomes:</strong><br />
        This unit helped me critically evaluate how emerging technologies like ACD intersect with foundational principles in risk assessment. I strengthened my ability to link academic theory (Aven, 2016) to practical innovation (Vyas et al., 2023) and gained insight into how decision-makers must evolve their risk frameworks to remain effective in a rapidly changing threat landscape.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        <strong>Professional Skills Matrix and Action Plan (PDP):</strong><br />
        I improved my skills in comparative literature analysis and learned to synthesise perspectives from different sources to formulate clear, evidence-based recommendations. I also refined my academic writing and referencing abilities in the process of crafting a wiki entry.<br /><br />
  
        <u>Action Plan:</u><br />
        - Explore further use cases of Explainable AI in cybersecurity across real-world deployments.<br />
        - Continue reviewing emerging risk trends through publications like the Journal of Cybersecurity and NIST bulletins.<br />
        - Manage my personal time more efficiently, since I struggled to deliver on time.

      <h2>Unit 6: Integrative Practice &amp; Future Trends Debate</h2>
    </header>

    <!-- Overview -->
    <p>
      The final unit consolidated everything learned throughout the module and challenged us to
      apply Security & Risk Management (SRM) techniques in two ways:
      a Python-based <em>Attack-Tree App</em> for the Pampered Pets case study, and
      a group debate on the trend most likely to shape SRM over the next five years,
      where our team argued for <em>Content-Centric / Named-Data Networking (CCN/NDN)</em>.
      The unit closed with a reflective essay on my overall learning journey.
    </p>

    <!-- Assignment 1 -->
    <h3>Assignment&nbsp;2: Pampered Pets Attack-Tree App</h3>
    <p>
      I coded an interactive Python tool that lets Pampered Pets’ adjust
      STRIDE-derived attack steps and instantly recompute overall success probabilities.
      The notebook automates:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Aggregation of <code>AND</code>/<code>OR</code> gates recursively untill an attack success % is reached.</li>
      <li>Visual output of the tree diagram with assigned probabilities</li>

    <h3>Debate Presentation: Why CCN/NDN Will Redefine SRM (2025-2030)</h3>
    <p>
      In the live seminar our team demonstrated how data-centric naming,
      intrinsic signatures and in-network caching can
      <em>shift SRM from perimeter-centric to content-centric security</em>.
      We compared CCN/NDN to P2P overlays and MobilityFirst,
      concluding that CCN/NDN offers the broadest, most transparent impact on
      data integrity, provenance and DDoS resilience.
